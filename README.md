# backup
This application helps maintain a list of paths you'd like to have backed up.

Whether backing up on a regular basis or just before migrating to a new hard disk, every now  and  again  one comes  across some
data worth holding on to. Whenever coming across a file or directory worth  keeping, backup should be used to add it to
backup.conf.

Backup can later be used to backup all the data accumulated in backup.conf.
